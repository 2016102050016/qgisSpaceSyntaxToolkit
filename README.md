# Space Syntax Toolkit for QGIS

The “Space Syntax Toolkit” is a [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) plug-in for spatial network and statistical analysis. It provides a front-end for the [depthmapX](https://varoudis.github.io/depthmapX/) software within QGIS, offering user friendly space syntax analysis workflows in a GIS environment. It enhances these workflows with standard GIS data, analysis and visualisation features. Although the toolkit is primarily aimed at supporting the standard space syntax methodology, the added functionality can be of general benefit to QGIS users by introducing new functionality for exploratory spatial data analysis.

The “Space Syntax Toolkit” consists currently of two modules: “Graph analysis” and “Attributes explorer”.
It is being developed by Jorge Gil at the Space Syntax Laboratory, The Bartlett, UCL.

## Where to find...
* The toolkit source code can be downloaded from the 'esstools' folder.
* The latest packaged plug-in can be found in the 'downloads' folder. It includes installation instructions. At the moment it is not yet available as a QGIS managed plugin.
