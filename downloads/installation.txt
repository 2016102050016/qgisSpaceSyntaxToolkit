Instructions to install the 'Space Syntax Toolkit' plugin for QGIS

At the moment the plug-in is not yet available through the QGIS plugins repository.
To install it you need to unzip the esstools.zip file and copy it into the QGIS plugins directory.
In MS Windows this is: C:/Users/[your user name]/.qgis2/python/plugins/
In Mac OSX this is: ~/.qgis2/python/plugins/
This folder is hidden and you must make hidden files and folders visible.

Once you start QGIS, the 'Space Syntax Toolkit' plugin will be available in the plugin manager window.
Check the box next to it to load the plugin and create the menu and toolbar buttons.
To use any of the tools select the appropriate button in the plugins toolbar, or in the 'Space Syntax Toolkit' section of the 'Plugins' menu.
