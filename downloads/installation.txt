Instructions to install the 'Space Syntax Toolkit' plugin for QGIS

At the moment, the plug-in is not yet available through the QGIS plugins repository.
To install it you need to download and unzip the esstoolkit.zip file and copy the entire eestoolkit folder into the QGIS plugins directory.
This directory can be found here:
* MS Windows: C:\Users\[your user name]\.qgis2\python\plugins\
* Mac OSX: Users/[your user name]/.qgis2/python/plugins/
* Linux: home/[your user name]/.qgis2/python/plugins/

This directory is hidden and you must make hidden files visible.
Under Mac OSX you can open it in Finder by selecting 'Go > Go To Folder...' and typing '~/.qgis2/python/plugins/'.

After copying the esstoolkit folder, once you start QGIS the 'Space Syntax Toolkit' plugin will be available in the plugin manager window.
Check the box next to it to load the plugin and create the menu and toolbar buttons.
To use any of the tools select the appropriate button in the plugins toolbar, or in the 'Space Syntax Toolkit' section of the 'Plugins' menu.
